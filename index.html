                        Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors.

            <h4><b>Hey, My name is Nazmul. I want to be <br> a Developer;</b></h4>
            <p>
                My occupation of choice is web Developer, and I chose this because even though I don't know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them. It's never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and effort into this, I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web Developer I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the <span> “World Wide Web” </span> was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility.That's why i chose web Developer.
