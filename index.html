            <h4><b>Hey, My name is Nazmul. I want to be <br> a Developer;</b></h4>
            <p>
                My occupation of choice is web Developer, and I chose this because even though I don't know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them. It's never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and effort into this, I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web Developer I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the <span> “World Wide Web” </span> was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility.That's why i chose web Developer.
